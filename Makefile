# The Dagger pipeline in ci/ is the single source of truth for tests.
# `make ci` runs locally exactly what GitHub Actions runs, so a green local run
# implies a green CI run. Do not add a second test path (docker-compose etc).
#
# The pipeline needs a reachable Dagger engine. Point the Dagger SDK at a remote
# engine by exporting _EXPERIMENTAL_DAGGER_RUNNER_HOST before running; it is
# inherited by `go run` below. The cluster upload step is skipped unless
# OTELHOUSEVIEW_UPLOAD=1 (CI sets it only on pushes to main).
